//This C++ class defines a function
//`addition` which takes two integer
//parameters, `A` and `B`, and returns
//their sum. Inside the function, it 
//simply adds `A` and `B` together and
//returns the result. This function can
//be used to perform addition operations 
//on two integers by creating an instance
//of the `Solution` class and calling its
//`addition` method with the integers you 
//want to add.
