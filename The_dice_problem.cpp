//This C++ class `Solution` contains
//a function `oppositeFaceOfDice` that
//calculates the opposite face of a 
//standard six-sided dice given the face 
//number `N`. In a standard dice, the sum
//of opposite faces is always 7. So, to 
//find the opposite face, the function 
//subtracts the given face number `N` from 
//7 and returns the result.
